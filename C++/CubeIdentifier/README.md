#Cube Identifier

This determines what kind of cube you have from an input file: whether it is Normal perfect, normal semi-perfect, abnormal perfect, abnormal semi-perfect, or imperfect.

It does this by analyzing:

	1. Whether there are repeated numbers in the cube

	2. Whether the rows' sums are equal

	3. Whether the pillars' sums are equal

	4. Whether the super diagonals' sums are equal

	5. Whether the orthogonal diagonals' sums are equal

	6. Whether it abides by the magic constant
