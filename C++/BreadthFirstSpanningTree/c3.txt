# It is an example of the generality of the file format.
# This file is not necessarily a good example to test any particular
# code, other than code to read in such a file.

# First comes the type of file
directed
# Vertices
# First how many?

# Then comes the description of the vertices
# <string description of vertex>
This is the first node in my graph.
The vertices do not need to come in any particular order
# I can embed comments anywhere
#
# If a vertex is mentioned more than once, then the graph file is in
# error.

I can have a vertex with a name any length I want, including a very very long name that might wrap around $
# Edges
# How many?

# Now the edges in the following format:
# <from>
# <to>
# (<weight>)
# Note that the weight is optional, and defaults to 1.
This is the first node in my graph.
The vertices do not need to come in any particular order
# notice there may be whitespace in front of the weight.

# Zero weights are also ok.

# You may not want them, but that doesn't mean the graph format
