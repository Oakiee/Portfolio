MVC Application created with Visual Studio | Utilized SQL Server Management Studio | Repository Design Pattern 

This was an application that allowed the user to add a DVD, view their list of DVDs and view more details on their DVD. 
Utilized a database that has 9 separate tables. Paul and I primarily worked in SQL Server Management Studio to create the database, 
create seed data and stored procedures. We also worked on the Add a DVD workflow in the MVC application.
