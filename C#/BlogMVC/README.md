C# MVC Application utilizing Visual Studio and Entity Framework Code-First Design

This MVC application simulates a blog where our client would like to create new posts, and static pages. 
They should be able to add photos, tags, and use a WYSIWYG text editor. They can edit and delete these. 
They would also like their employees to make posts, but only they can approve and publish them.
