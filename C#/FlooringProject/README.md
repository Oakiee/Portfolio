Repository Design Pattern

This project entailed reading and writing from order files, distinguished by filenames according to the date of the order. 

The user was able to do the following:

	- Display all orders at a given date
	- Add a new order
	- Edit an existing order
	- Remove an order
	
This project utilized the Repository Design Pattern and as such featured a Data layer consisting of repos, a BLL layer consisting of 
managers and a UI layer consisting of menus and workflows.
