Do you happen to know the show American Pickers? We were tasked with creating an RPG so I decided to make a simulation of American Pickers for fun. 

The player goes through these various locations to buy items from their owners, in hopes of reselling them for a higher price. 
Sometimes the owner is not willing to part with their items though. 
After visiting all the possible locations, the player's score is tallied up by profit margin, and explanations of the resale values are shown. 

This game featured inheritance from the base classes of location and item.
